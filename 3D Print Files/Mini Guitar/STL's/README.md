These files are a direct export of a full layout from the Bambu Studio .3MF file for the guitars. 

There are two sets of fret keys - one set is all black, one set is colored. Dimensionally, they're all the same. Print these, and the strum bar in 100% infill.

If you choose to print the Mini guitar, make sure to print the mini guitar neck, and mini guitar headstock.
If you choose to print the Full sized guitar, make sure to print the full sized neck, and full sized headstock.
The rest of the pieces are the same between the two guitars.
