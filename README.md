# DIY-Clone-Hero-YARG-Guitar-Set
A 3D Printed Full Size and Mini Guitar for Clone Hero and YARG

This is heavily based on the design of dmcke5, and the originals can be found at https://github.com/dmcke5/DIYCloneHeroController

I have modified the body in a few various ways, and updated the controller board to a Raspberry Pi Pico with a type-C USB interface.
